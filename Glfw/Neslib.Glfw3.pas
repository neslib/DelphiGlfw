{************************************************************************
 * GLFW API functions
 ************************************************************************}

{ Initializes the GLFW library.

  This function initializes the GLFW library.  Before most GLFW functions can
  be used, GLFW must be initialized, and before an application terminates GLFW
  should be terminated in order to free any resources allocated during or
  after initialization.


  If this function fails, it calls glfwTerminate before returning.  If it
  succeeds, you should call glfwTerminate before the application exits.

  Additional calls to this function after successful initialization but before
  termination will return <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> immediately.

  Returns:
    <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> if successful, or <tt>GLFW_FALSE</tt> if an error
    occurred.

  Possible errors include GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  On macOS, this function will change the current directory of the application
  to the <tt>Contents/Resources</tt> subdirectory of the application's bundle,
  if present.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

  SeeAlso:
    glfwTerminate

  Added in version 1.0. }
function glfwInit(): Integer;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwInit';

{ Terminates the GLFW library.

  This function destroys all remaining windows and cursors, restores any
  modified gamma ramps and frees any other allocated resources.  Once this
  function is called, you must again call glfwInit successfully before
  you will be able to use most GLFW functions.

  If GLFW has been successfully initialized, this function should be called
  before the application exits.  If initialization fails, there is no need to
  call this function, as it is called by glfwInit before it returns failure.

  Possible errors include GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  This function may be called before glfwInit.

  The contexts of any remaining windows must not be current on any other thread
  when this function is called.

  This function must not be called from a callback.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

  SeeAlso:
    glfwInit

  Added in version 1.0. }
procedure glfwTerminate();
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwTerminate';

{ Sets the specified init hint to the desired value.

  This function sets hints for the next initialization of GLFW.

  The values you set hints to are never reset by GLFW, but they only take
  effect during initialization. Once GLFW has been initialized, any values
  you set will be ignored until the library is terminated and initialized
  again.

  Some hints are platform specific. These may be set on any platform but they
  will only affect their specific platform. Other platforms will ignore them.
  Setting these hints requires no platform specific headers or functions.

  Parameters:
    hint: The init hint to set.
    value: The new value of the init hint.

  Possible errors include GLFW_INVALID_ENUM and GLFW_INVALID_VALUE.

  This function may be called before glfwInit.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

  SeeAlso:
    glfwInit

  Added in version 3.3. }
procedure glfwInitHint(hint, value: Integer);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwInitHint';

{ Retrieves the version of the GLFW library.

  This function retrieves the major, minor and revision numbers of the GLFW
  library.  It is intended for when you are using GLFW as a shared library and
  want to ensure that you are using the minimum required version.

  Any or all of the version arguments may be <tt>nil</tt>.

  Parameters:
    major: Where to store the major version number, or <tt>nil</tt>.
    minor: Where to store the minor version number, or <tt>nil</tt>.
    rev: Where to store the revision number, or <tt>nil</tt>.

  This function may be called before glfwInit.

  This function may be called from any thread.

  SeeAlso:
    glfwGetVersionString

  Added in version 1.0. }
procedure glfwGetVersion(major, minor, rev: PInteger);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetVersion';

{ Returns a string describing the compile-time configuration.

  This function returns the compile-time generated version string of the GLFW
  library binary.  It describes the version, platform, compiler and any
  platform-specific compile-time options.  It should not be confused with the
  OpenGL or OpenGL ES version string, queried with <tt>glGetString</tt>.

  <b>Do not use the version string</b> to parse the GLFW library version.  The
  glfwGetVersion function provides the version of the running library binary in
  numerical format.

  Returns:
    The ASCII encoded GLFW version string.

  This function may be called before glfwInit.

  The returned string is static and compile-time generated.

  This function may be called from any thread.

  SeeAlso:
    glfwGetVersion

  Added in version 3.0. }
function glfwGetVersionString(): PAnsiChar;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetVersionString';

{ Returns and clears the last error for the calling thread.

  This function returns and clears the error codeof the last error that occurred
  on the calling thread, and optionally a UTF-8 encoded human-readable
  description of it. If no error has occurred since the last call, it returns
  GLFW_NO_ERROR (zero) and the description pointer is set to <tt>nil</tt>.

  Parameters:
    description: Where to store the error description pointer, or <tt>nil</tt>.

  Returns:
    The last error code for the calling thread, or GLFW_NO_ERROR (zero).

  The returned string is allocated and freed by GLFW. You should not free it
  yourself. It is guaranteed to be valid only until the next error occurs or the
  library is terminated.

  This function may be called before glfwInit.

  This function may be called from any thread.

  SeeAlso:
    glfwSetErrorCallback

  Added in version 3.3. }
function glfwGetError(const description: PPAnsiChar): Integer;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetError';

{ Sets the error callback.

  This function sets the error callback, which is called with an error code
  and a human-readable description each time a GLFW error occurs.

  The error callback is called on the thread where the error occurred.  If you
  are using GLFW from multiple threads, your error callback needs to be
  written accordingly.

  Because the description string may have been generated specifically for that
  error, it is not guaranteed to be valid after the callback has returned.  If
  you wish to use it after the callback returns, you need to make a copy.

  Once set, the error callback remains set even after the library has been
  terminated.

  Parameters:
    cbfun: The new callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently set
      callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set.

  This function may be called before glfwInit.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

  Added in version 3.0. }
function glfwSetErrorCallback(cbfun: TGLFWerrorfun): TGLFWerrorfun;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwSetErrorCallback';

{ Returns the currently connected monitors.

  This function returns an array of handles for all currently connected
  monitors.  The primary monitor is always first in the returned array.  If no
  monitors were found, this function returns <tt>nil</tt>.

  Parameters:
    count: Where to store the number of monitors in the returned
      array.  This is set to zero if an error occurred.

  Returns:
    An array of monitor handles, or <tt>nil</tt> if no monitors were found or
    if an error occurred.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

  The returned array is allocated and freed by GLFW.  You should not free it
  yourself.  It is guaranteed to be valid only until the monitor configuration
  changes or the library is terminated.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

  SeeAlso:

  Added in version 3.0. }
procedure glfwGetMonitorPos(monitor: PGLFWmonitor; xpos, ypos: PInteger);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetMonitorPos';

{ Retrieves the work area of the monitor.

  This function returns the position, in screen coordinates, of the upper-left
  corner of the work area of the specified monitor along with the work area
  size in screen coordinates. The work area is defined as the area of the
  monitor not occluded by the operating system task bar where present. If no
  task bar exists then the work area is the monitor resolution in screen
  coordinates.

  Any or all of the position and size arguments may be <tt>nil</tt>. If an error
  occurs, all non-<tt>nil</tt> position and size arguments will be set to zero.

  Parameters:
    monitor: The monitor to query.
    xpos: Where to store the monitor x-coordinate, or <tt>nil</tt>.
    ypos: Where to store the monitor y-coordinate, or <tt>nil</tt>.

procedure glfwGetMonitorWorkarea(monitor: PGLFWmonitor; xpos, ypos, width, height: PInteger);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetMonitorWorkarea';

{ Returns the physical size of the monitor.

  This function returns the size, in millimetres, of the display area of the
  specified monitor.

  Some systems do not provide accurate monitor size information, either
  because the monitor EDID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_display_identification_data)
  data is incorrect or because the driver does not report it accurately.

  Any or all of the size arguments may be <tt>nil</tt>.  If an error occurs, all
  non-<tt>nil</tt> size arguments will be set to zero.

  Parameters:
    monitor: The monitor to query.
    widthMM: Where to store the width, in millimetres, of the
      monitor's display area, or <tt>nil</tt>.
    heightMM: Where to store the height, in millimetres, of the
      monitor's display area, or <tt>nil</tt>.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

  On Windows, calculates the returned physical size from the current resolution
  and system DPI instead of querying the monitor EDID data.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

  Added in version 3.0. }
procedure glfwGetMonitorPhysicalSize(monitor: PGLFWmonitor; widthMM, heightMM: PInteger);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetMonitorPhysicalSize';

{ Retrieves the content scale for the specified monitor.

  This function retrieves the content scale for the specified monitor. The
  content scale is the ratio between the current DPI and the platform's
  default DPI. This is especially important for text and any UI elements. If
  the pixel dimensions of your UI scaled by this look appropriate on your
  machine then it should appear at a reasonable size on other machines
  regardless of their DPI and scaling settings. This relies on the system DPI
  and scaling settings being somewhat correct.
  The content scale may depend on both the monitor resolution and pixel
  density and on user settings. It may be very different from the raw DPI
  calculated from the physical size and current resolution.
  
  Parameters:
    monitor: The monitor to query.
    xscale: Where to store the x-axis content scale, or <tt>nil</tt>.
    yscale: Where to store the y-axis content scale, or <tt>nil</tt>.

procedure glfwGetMonitorContentScale(monitor: PGLFWmonitor; xscale, yscale: PSingle);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetMonitorContentScale';

{ Returns the name of the specified monitor.

  This function returns a human-readable name, encoded as UTF-8, of the
  specified monitor.  The name typically reflects the make and model of the
  monitor and is not guaranteed to be unique among the connected monitors.

  Parameters:
    monitor: The monitor to query.

  Returns:
    The UTF-8 encoded name of the monitor, or <tt>nil</tt> if an error
    occurred.

{ Creates a window and its associated context.

  This function creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES
  context.  Most of the options controlling how the window and its context
  should be created are specified with window hints.

  Successful creation does not change which context is current.  Before you
  can use the newly created context, you need to make it current.

  The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you
  requested, as not all parameters and hints are hard constraints.  This
  includes the size of the window, especially for full screen windows.  To query
  the actual attributes of the created window, framebuffer and context, see
  glfwGetWindowAttrib, glfwGetWindowSize and glfwGetFramebufferSize.

  To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window
  will cover.  If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode.
  Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is
  recommended that you pick the primary monitor.

  For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the
  window's <i>desired video mode</i>.  As long as a full screen window is not
  iconified, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video
  mode is set for the specified monitor.

  Once you have created the window, you can switch it between windowed and
  full screen mode with glfwSetWindowMonitor.  If the window has an OpenGL or
  OpenGL ES context, it will be unaffected.

  By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the
  window system.  To create the window at a specific position, make it
  initially invisible using the GLFW_VISIBLE window hint, set its position
  and then show it.

  As long as at least one full screen window is not iconified, the screensaver
  is prohibited from starting.

  Window systems put limits on window sizes.  Very large or very small window
  dimensions may be overridden by the window system on creation.  Check the
  actual size after creation.

  The swap interval is not set during window creation and the initial value may
  vary depending on driver settings and defaults.

  Parameters:
    width: The desired width, in screen coordinates, of the window.
      This must be greater than zero.
    height: The desired height, in screen coordinates, of the window.
      This must be greater than zero.
    title: The initial, UTF-8 encoded window title.
    monitor: The monitor to use for full screen mode, or <tt>nil</tt> for
      windowed mode.
    share: The window whose context to share resources with, or <tt>nil</tt>
      to not share resources.

  Returns:
    The handle of the created window, or <tt>nil</tt> if an error occurred.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, GLFW_INVALID_ENUM,
  GLFW_INVALID_VALUE, GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE, GLFW_VERSION_UNAVAILABLE,
  GLFW_FORMAT_UNAVAILABLE and GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  On Windows, window creation will fail if the Microsoft GDI software OpenGL
  implementation is the only one available.

  On Windows, if the executable has an icon resource named <tt>GLFW_ICON,</tt>
  it will be set as the initial icon for the window.  If no such icon is
  present, the <tt>IDI_WINLOGO</tt> icon will be used instead.  To set a
  different icon, see glfwSetWindowIcon.

  On Windows, the context to share resources with must not be current on
  any other thread.

  On macOS, the GLFW window has no icon, as it is not a document window, but the
  dock icon will be the same as the application bundle's icon. For more
  information on bundles, see the Bundle Programming Guide
  (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/)
  in the Mac Developer Library.

  On macOS, the first time a window is created the menu bar is populated with
  common commands like Hide, Quit and About.  The About entry opens a minimal
  about dialog with information from the application's bundle.

  On OS X 10.10 and later the window frame will not be rendered at full
  resolution on Retina displays unless the <tt>NSHighResolutionCapable</tt>
  key is enabled in the application bundle's <tt>Info.plist</tt>.  For more
  information, see High Resolution Guidelines for OS X

{ Sets the icon for the specified window.

  This function sets the icon of the specified window.  If passed an array of
  candidate images, those of or closest to the sizes desired by the system are
  selected.  If no images are specified, the window reverts to its default
  icon.

{ Sets the size limits of the specified window.

  This function sets the size limits of the client area of the specified
  window.  If the window is full screen, the size limits only take effect
  once it is made windowed.  If the window is not resizable, this function
  does nothing.

  The size limits are applied immediately to a windowed mode window and may
  cause it to be resized.

  The maximum dimensions must be greater than or equal to the minimum
  dimensions and all must be greater than or equal to zero.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to set limits for.
    minwidth: The minimum width, in screen coordinates, of the client
      area, or <tt>GLFW_DONT_CARE</tt>.

{ Sets the aspect ratio of the specified window.

  This function sets the required aspect ratio of the client area of the
  specified window.  If the window is full screen, the aspect ratio only takes
  effect once it is made windowed.  If the window is not resizable, this
  function does nothing.

  The aspect ratio is specified as a numerator and a denominator and both
  values must be greater than zero.  For example, the common 16:9 aspect ratio
  is specified as 16 and 9, respectively.

  If the numerator and denominator is set to <tt>GLFW_DONT_CARE</tt> then the
  aspect ratio limit is disabled.

  The aspect ratio is applied immediately to a windowed mode window and may
  cause it to be resized.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to set limits for.
    numer: The numerator of the desired aspect ratio, or
      <tt>GLFW_DONT_CARE</tt>.
    denom: The denominator of the desired aspect ratio, or
      <tt>GLFW_DONT_CARE</tt>.

{ Sets the size of the client area of the specified window.

  This function sets the size, in screen coordinates, of the client area of
  the specified window.

  For full screen windows, this function updates the resolution of its desired
  video mode and switches to the video mode closest to it, without affecting
  the window's context.  As the context is unaffected, the bit depths of the
  framebuffer remain unchanged.

  If you wish to update the refresh rate of the desired video mode in addition
  to its resolution, see glfwSetWindowMonitor.

  The window manager may put limits on what sizes are allowed.  GLFW cannot
  and should not override these limits.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to resize.
    width: The desired width, in screen coordinates, of the window
      client area.
    height: The desired height, in screen coordinates, of the window
      client area.

{ Retrieves the size of the frame of the window.

  This function retrieves the size, in screen coordinates, of each edge of the
  frame of the specified window.  This size includes the title bar, if the
  window has one.  The size of the frame may vary depending on the
  window-related hints used to create it.

  Because this function retrieves the size of each window frame edge and not
  the offset along a particular coordinate axis, the retrieved values will
  always be zero or positive.

  Any or all of the size arguments may be <tt>nil</tt>.  If an error occurs, all
  non-<tt>nil</tt> size arguments will be set to zero.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose frame size to query.
    left: Where to store the size, in screen coordinates, of the left
      edge of the window frame, or <tt>nil</tt>.
    top: Where to store the size, in screen coordinates, of the top

{ Retrieves the content scale for the specified window.

  This function retrieves the content scale for the specified window. The
  content scale is the ratio between the current DPI and the platform's
  default DPI. This is especially important for text and any UI elements. If
  the pixel dimensions of your UI scaled by this look appropriate on your
  machine then it should appear at a reasonable size on other machines
  regardless of their DPI and scaling settings. This relies on the system DPI
  and scaling settings being somewhat correct.

  On systems where each monitors can have its own content scale, the window
  content scale will depend on which monitor the system considers the window
  to be on.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to query.
    xscale: Where to store the x-axis content scale, or <tt>nil</tt>.
    yscale: Where to store the y-axis content scale, or <tt>nil</tt>.

{ Brings the specified window to front and sets input focus.

  This function brings the specified window to front and sets input focus.
  The window should already be visible and not iconified.

  By default, both windowed and full screen mode windows are focused when
  initially created.  Set GLFW_FOCUSED to disable this behavior.

  <b>Do not use this function</b> to steal focus from other applications unless
  you are certain that is what the user wants.  Focus stealing can be
  extremely disruptive.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to give input focus.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED and GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

{ Requests user attention to the specified window.

  This function requests user attention to the specified window. On
  platforms where this is not supported, attention is requested to the
  application as a whole.

  Once the user has given attention, usually by focusing the window or
  application, the system will end the request automatically.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to request attention to.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED and GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  MacOS: Attention is requested to the application as a whole, not the specific
  window.

{ Returns the monitor that the window uses for full screen mode.

  This function returns the handle of the monitor that the specified window is
  in full screen on.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to query.

  Returns:
    The monitor, or <tt>nil</tt> if the window is in windowed mode or an
    error occurred.

{ Sets the mode, monitor, video mode and placement of a window.

  This function sets the monitor that the window uses for full screen mode or,
  if the monitor is <tt>nil</tt>, makes it windowed mode.

  When setting a monitor, this function updates the width, height and refresh
  rate of the desired video mode and switches to the video mode closest to it.
  The window position is ignored when setting a monitor.

  When the monitor is <tt>nil</tt>, the position, width and height are used to
  place the window client area.  The refresh rate is ignored when no monitor
  is specified.

  If you only wish to update the resolution of a full screen window or the
  size of a windowed mode window, see glfwSetWindowSize.

  When a window transitions from full screen to windowed mode, this function
  restores any previous window settings such as whether it is decorated,
  floating, resizable, has size or aspect ratio limits, etc..

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose monitor, size or video mode to set.
    monitor: The desired monitor, or <tt>nil</tt> to set windowed mode.
    xpos: The desired x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
      client area.
    ypos: The desired y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
      client area.
    width: The desired with, in screen coordinates, of the client area
      or video mode.
    height: The desired height, in screen coordinates, of the client
      area or video mode.
    refreshRate: The desired refresh rate, in Hz, of the video mode,
      or <tt>GLFW_DONT_CARE</tt>.

{ Returns an attribute of the specified window.

  This function returns the value of an attribute of the specified window or
  its OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to query.
    attrib: The window attribute whose value to return.

  Returns:
    The value of the attribute, or zero if an error occurred.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, GLFW_INVALID_ENUM and
  GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  Framebuffer related hints are not window attributes.

  Zero is a valid value for many window and context related attributes so you
  cannot use a return value of zero as an indication of errors.  However, this
  function should not fail as long as it is passed valid arguments and the
  library has been initialized.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

{ Sets an attribute of the specified window.

  This function sets the value of an attribute of the specified window.

  The supported attributes are GLFW_DECORATED, GLFW_RESIZABLE, GLFW_FLOATING,
  GLFW_AUTO_ICONIFY and GLFW_FOCUS_ON_SHOW.

  Some of these attributes are ignored for full screen windows. The new
  value will take effect if the window is later made windowed.

  Some of these attributes are ignored for windowed mode windows. The new
  value will take effect if the window is later made full screen.

  Parameters:
    window: The window to set the attribute for.
    attrib: A supported window attribute.
    value: <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> or <tt>GLFW_FALSE</tt>.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, GLFW_INVALID_ENUM,

{ Sets the close callback for the specified window.

  This function sets the close callback of the specified window, which is
  called when the user attempts to close the window, for example by clicking
  the close widget in the title bar.

  The close flag is set before this callback is called, but you can modify it
  at any time with glfwSetWindowShouldClose.

  The close callback is not triggered by glfwDestroyWindow.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently set
      callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or the

{ Sets the refresh callback for the specified window.

  This function sets the refresh callback of the specified window, which is
  called when the client area of the window needs to be redrawn, for example
  if the window has been exposed after having been covered by another window.

  On compositing window systems such as Aero, Compiz or Aqua, where the window
  contents are saved off-screen, this callback may be called only very
  infrequently or never at all.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently set
      callback.

  Returns:

{ Sets the focus callback for the specified window.

  This function sets the focus callback of the specified window, which is
  called when the window gains or loses input focus.

  After the focus callback is called for a window that lost input focus,
  synthetic key and mouse button release events will be generated for all such
  that had been pressed.  For more information, see glfwSetKeyCallback
  and glfwSetMouseButtonCallback.

{ Processes all pending events.

  This function processes only those events that are already in the event
  queue and then returns immediately.  Processing events will cause the window
  and input callbacks associated with those events to be called.

  On some platforms, a window move, resize or menu operation will cause event
  processing to block.  This is due to how event processing is designed on
  those platforms.  You can use the window refresh callback to redraw the
  contents of your window when necessary during such operations.

  On some platforms, certain events are sent directly to the application
  without going through the event queue, causing callbacks to be called
  outside of a call to one of the event processing functions.

  Event processing is not required for joystick input to work.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED and GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  This function must not be called from a callback.

{ Waits until events are queued and processes them.

  This function puts the calling thread to sleep until at least one event is
  available in the event queue.  Once one or more events are available,
  it behaves exactly like glfwPollEvents, i.e. the events in the queue
  are processed and the function then returns immediately.  Processing events
  will cause the window and input callbacks associated with those events to be
  called.

  Since not all events are associated with callbacks, this function may return
  without a callback having been called even if you are monitoring all
  callbacks.

{ Waits with timeout until events are queued and processes them.

  This function puts the calling thread to sleep until at least one event is
  available in the event queue, or until the specified timeout is reached.  If
  one or more events are available, it behaves exactly like glfwPollEvents,
  i.e. the events in the queue are processed and the function then returns
  immediately.  Processing events will cause the window and input callbacks
  associated with those events to be called.

  The timeout value must be a positive finite number.

function glfwGetInputMode(window: PGLFWwindow; mode: Integer): Integer;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetInputMode';

{ Sets an input option for the specified window.

  This function sets an input mode option for the specified window.  The mode
  must be one of <tt>GLFW_CURSOR</tt>, <tt>GLFW_STICKY_KEYS</tt> or
  <tt>GLFW_STICKY_MOUSE_BUTTONS</tt>.

  If the mode is <tt>GLFW_CURSOR</tt>, the value must be one of the following
  cursor modes:
  * <tt>GLFW_CURSOR_NORMAL</tt> makes the cursor visible and behaving normally.
  * <tt>GLFW_CURSOR_HIDDEN</tt> makes the cursor invisible when it is over the
    client area of the window but does not restrict the cursor from leaving.
  * <tt>GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED</tt> hides and grabs the cursor, providing virtual
    and unlimited cursor movement.  This is useful for implementing for
    example 3D camera controls.

  If the mode is <tt>GLFW_STICKY_KEYS</tt>, the value must be either
  <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> to enable sticky keys, or <tt>GLFW_FALSE</tt> to disable
  it.  If sticky keys are enabled, a key press will ensure that glfwGetKey
  returns <tt>GLFW_PRESS</tt> the next time it is called even if the key had
  been released before the call.  This is useful when you are only interested
  in whether keys have been pressed but not when or in which order.

  If the mode is <tt>GLFW_STICKY_MOUSE_BUTTONS</tt>, the value must be either
  <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> to enable sticky mouse buttons, or <tt>GLFW_FALSE</tt> to
  disable it. If sticky mouse buttons are enabled, a mouse button press will
  ensure that glfwGetMouseButton returns <tt>GLFW_PRESS</tt> the next time it
  is called even if the mouse button had been released before the call.  This
  is useful when you are only interested in whether mouse buttons have been
  pressed but not when or in which order.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose input mode to set.
    mode: One of <tt>GLFW_CURSOR</tt>, <tt>GLFW_STICKY_KEYS</tt> or
      <tt>GLFW_STICKY_MOUSE_BUTTONS</tt>.

{ Returns whether raw mouse motion is supported.

  This function returns whether raw mouse motion is supported on the current
  system. This status does not change after GLFW has been initialized so you
  only need to check this once. If you attempt to enable raw motion on
  a system that does not support it, GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR will be emitted.

  Raw mouse motion is closer to the actual motion of the mouse across
  a surface. It is not affected by the scaling and acceleration applied to
  the motion of the desktop cursor. That processing is suitable for a cursor
  while raw motion is better for controlling for example a 3D camera. Because
  of this, raw mouse motion is only provided when the cursor is disabled.

  Returns:
    <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> if raw mouse motion is supported on the current machine,
    or <tt>GLFW_FALSE</tt> otherwise.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

  This function returns the localized name of the specified printable key.
  This is intended for displaying key bindings to the user.

  If the key is <tt>GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN</tt>, the scancode is used instead,
  otherwise the scancode is ignored.  If a non-printable key or (if the key is

{ Returns the last reported state of a keyboard key for the specified
  window.

  This function returns the last state reported for the specified key to the
  specified window.  The returned state is one of <tt>GLFW_PRESS</tt> or
  <tt>GLFW_RELEASE</tt>.  The higher-level action <tt>GLFW_REPEAT</tt> is only
  reported to the key callback.

  If the <tt>GLFW_STICKY_KEYS</tt> input mode is enabled, this function returns
  <tt>GLFW_PRESS</tt> the first time you call it for a key that was pressed,
  even if that key has already been released.

  The key functions deal with physical keys, with key tokens named after their
  use on the standard US keyboard layout.  If you want to input text, use the
  Unicode character callback instead.

  The modifier key bit masks are not key tokens and cannot be used with this
  function.

  <b>Do not use this function</b> to implement text input.

  Parameters:
    window: The desired window.
    key: The desired keyboard key.  <tt>GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN</tt> is
     not a valid key for this function.

{ Retrieves the position of the cursor relative to the client area of
  the window.

  This function returns the position of the cursor, in screen coordinates,
  relative to the upper-left corner of the client area of the specified
  window.

  If the cursor is disabled (with <tt>GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED</tt>) then the cursor
  position is unbounded and limited only by the minimum and maximum values of
  a <tt>double</tt>.

  The coordinate can be converted to their integer equivalents with the
  <tt>floor</tt> function.  Casting directly to an integer type works for
  positive coordinates, but fails for negative ones.

  Any or all of the position arguments may be <tt>nil</tt>.  If an error occurs,
  all non-<tt>nil</tt> position arguments will be set to zero.

  Parameters:
    window: The desired window.
    xpos: Where to store the cursor x-coordinate, relative to the
      left edge of the client area, or <tt>nil</tt>.
    ypos: Where to store the cursor y-coordinate, relative to the to

{ Sets the position of the cursor, relative to the client area of the
  window.

  This function sets the position, in screen coordinates, of the cursor
  relative to the upper-left corner of the client area of the specified
  window.  The window must have input focus.  If the window does not have
  input focus when this function is called, it fails silently.

  <b>Do not use this function</b> to implement things like camera controls.
  GLFW already provides the <tt>GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED</tt> cursor mode that hides
  the cursor, transparently re-centers it and provides unconstrained cursor
  motion.  See glfwSetInputMode for more information.

  If the cursor mode is <tt>GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED</tt> then the cursor position
  is unconstrained and limited only by the minimum and maximum values of
  a <tt>double</tt>.

  Parameters:
    window: The desired window.
    xpos: The desired x-coordinate, relative to the left edge of the

{ Creates a custom cursor.

  Creates a new custom cursor image that can be set for a window with
  glfwSetCursor.  The cursor can be destroyed with glfwDestroyCursor.
  Any remaining cursors are destroyed by glfwTerminate.

  The pixels are 32-bit, little-endian, non-premultiplied RGBA, i.e. eight
  bits per channel.  They are arranged canonically as packed sequential rows,
  starting from the top-left corner.

  The cursor hotspot is specified in pixels, relative to the upper-left corner
  of the cursor image.  Like all other coordinate systems in GLFW, the X-axis
  points to the right and the Y-axis points down.

  Parameters:
    image: The desired cursor image.
    xhot: The desired x-coordinate, in pixels, of the cursor hotspot.
    yhot: The desired y-coordinate, in pixels, of the cursor hotspot.

  Returns:

procedure glfwSetCursor(window: PGLFWwindow; cursor: PGLFWcursor);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwSetCursor';

{ Sets the key callback.

  This function sets the key callback of the specified window, which is called
  when a key is pressed, repeated or released.

  The key functions deal with physical keys, with layout independent
  key tokens named after their values in the standard US keyboard
  layout.  If you want to input text, use the character callback instead.

  When a window loses input focus, it will generate synthetic key release
  events for all pressed keys.  You can tell these events from user-generated
  events by the fact that the synthetic ones are generated after the focus
  loss event has been processed, i.e. after the window focus callback
  (glfwSetWindowFocusCallback) has been called.

  The scancode of a key is specific to that platform or sometimes even to that
  machine.  Scancodes are intended to allow users to bind keys that don't have
  a GLFW key token.  Such keys have <tt>key</tt> set to
  <tt>GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN</tt>, their state is not saved and so it cannot be
  queried with glfwGetKey.

  Sometimes GLFW needs to generate synthetic key events, in which case the
  scancode may be zero.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new key callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently
     set callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or the
    library had not been initialized.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

  Added in version 1.0. GLFW3 added window handle parameter and return value. }
function glfwSetKeyCallback(window: PGLFWwindow; cbfun: TGLFWkeyfun): TGLFWkeyfun;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwSetKeyCallback';

{ Sets the Unicode character callback.

  This function sets the character callback of the specified window, which is
  called when a Unicode character is input.

  The character callback is intended for Unicode text input.  As it deals with
  characters, it is keyboard layout dependent, whereas the key callback
  (glfwSetKeyCallback) is not.  Characters do not map 1:1 to physical keys, as
  a key may produce zero, one or more characters.  If you want to know whether
  a specific physical key was pressed or released, see the key callback instead.

  The character callback behaves as system text input normally does and will
  not be called if modifier keys are held down that would prevent normal text
  input on that platform, for example a Super (Command) key on OS X or Alt key
  on Windows.  There is a character with modifiers callback
  (glfwSetCharModsCallback) that receives these events.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently set
      callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or the
    library had not been initialized.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

  This function must only be called from the main thread.

function glfwSetCharCallback(window: PGLFWwindow; cbfun: TGLFWcharfun): TGLFWcharfun;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwSetCharCallback';

{ Sets the Unicode character with modifiers callback.

  This function sets the character with modifiers callback of the specified
  window, which is called when a Unicode character is input regardless of what
  modifier keys are used.

  The character with modifiers callback is intended for implementing custom
  Unicode character input.  For regular Unicode text input, see the
  character callback (glfwSetCharCallback).  Like the character callback, the
  character with modifiers callback deals with characters and is keyboard
  layout dependent.  Characters do not map 1:1 to physical keys, as a key may
  produce zero, one or more characters.  If you want to know whether a
  specific physical key was pressed or released, see the  key callback
  (glfwSetKeyCallback) instead.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently set
      callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or an
    error occurred.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwSetCharModsCallback';

{ Sets the mouse button callback.

  This function sets the mouse button callback of the specified window, which
  is called when a mouse button is pressed or released.

  When a window loses input focus, it will generate synthetic mouse button
  release events for all pressed mouse buttons.  You can tell these events
  from user-generated events by the fact that the synthetic ones are generated
  after the focus loss event has been processed, i.e. after the
  window focus callback (glfwSetWindowFocusCallback) has been called.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently set
      callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or the
    library had not been initialized.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

{ Sets the cursor position callback.

  This function sets the cursor position callback of the specified window,
  which is called when the cursor is moved.  The callback is provided with the
  position, in screen coordinates, relative to the upper-left corner of the
  client area of the window.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently set
      callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or the
    library had not been initialized.

{ Sets the cursor enter/exit callback.

  This function sets the cursor boundary crossing callback of the specified
  window, which is called when the cursor enters or leaves the client area of
  the window.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently set
      callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or the

{ Sets the scroll callback.

  This function sets the scroll callback of the specified window, which is
  called when a scrolling device is used, such as a mouse wheel or scrolling
  area of a touchpad.

  The scroll callback receives all scrolling input, like that from a mouse
  wheel or a touchpad scrolling area.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new scroll callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the currently
      set callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or the
    library had not been initialized.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

{ Sets the file drop callback.

  This function sets the file drop callback of the specified window, which is
  called when one or more dragged files are dropped on the window.

  Because the path array and its strings may have been generated specifically
  for that event, they are not guaranteed to be valid after the callback has
  returned.  If you wish to use them after the callback returns, you need to
  make a deep copy.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose callback to set.
    cbfun: The new file drop callback, or <tt>nil</tt> to remove the
      currently set callback.

  Returns:
    The previously set callback, or <tt>nil</tt> if no callback was set or the
    library had not been initialized.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

{ Returns the SDL compatible GUID of the specified joystick.

  This function returns the SDL compatible GUID, as a UTF-8 encoded
  hexadecimal string, of the specified joystick. The returned string is
  allocated and freed by GLFW. You should not free it yourself.

  The GUID is what connects a joystick to a gamepad mapping. A connected
  joystick will always have a GUID even if there is no gamepad mapping
  assigned to it.

  If the specified joystick is not present this function will return
  <tt>nil</tt> but will not generate an error. This can be used instead of first
  calling glfwJoystickPresent.

  The GUID uses the format introduced in SDL 2.0.5. This GUID tries to
  uniquely identify the make and model of a joystick but does not identify
  a specific unit, e.g. all wired Xbox 360 controllers will have the same
  GUID on that platform. The GUID for a unit may vary between platforms
  depending on what hardware information the platform specific APIs provide.

  Parameters:
    jid: The joystick to query.

{ Adds the specified SDL_GameControllerDB gamepad mappings.

  This function parses the specified ASCII encoded string and updates the
  internal list with any gamepad mappings it finds. This string may
  contain either a single gamepad mapping or many mappings separated by
  newlines. The parser supports the full format of the `gamecontrollerdb.txt`
  source file including empty lines and comments.

  If there is already a gamepad mapping for a given GUID in the internal list,
  it will be replaced by the one passed to this function. If the library is
  terminated and re-initialized the internal list will revert to the built-in
  default.

  Parameters:
    str: The string containing the gamepad mappings.

  Returns:
    <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> if successful, or <tt>GLFW_FALSE</tt> if an
    erroroccurred.

{ Returns the contents of the clipboard as a string.

  This function returns the contents of the system clipboard, if it contains
  or is convertible to a UTF-8 encoded string.  If the clipboard is empty or
  if its contents cannot be converted, <tt>nil</tt> is returned and a
  GLFW_FORMAT_UNAVAILABLE error is generated.

  Parameters:
    window: The window that will request the clipboard contents.

  Returns:

{ Returns the value of the GLFW timer.

  This function returns the value of the GLFW timer.  Unless the timer has
  been set using glfwSetTime, the timer measures time elapsed since GLFW
  was initialized.

  The resolution of the timer is system dependent, but is usually on the order
  of a few micro- or nanoseconds.  It uses the highest-resolution monotonic
  time source on each supported platform.

  Returns: The current value, in seconds, or zero if an error occurred.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

  This function may be called from any thread.  Reading and
  writing of the internal timer offset is not atomic, so it needs to be
  externally synchronized with calls to glfwSetTime.

  Added in version 1.0. }
function glfwGetTime(): Double;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwGetTime';

{ Sets the GLFW timer.

  This function sets the value of the GLFW timer.  It then continues to count
  up from that value.  The value must be a positive finite number less than
  or equal to 18446744073.0, which is approximately 584.5 years.

  Parameters:
    time: The new value, in seconds.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED and GLFW_INVALID_VALUE.

  This function may be called from any thread.  Reading and

{ Makes the context of the specified window current for the calling thread.

  This function makes the OpenGL or OpenGL ES context of the specified window
  current on the calling thread.  A context can only be made current on
  a single thread at a time and each thread can have only a single current
  context at a time.

  By default, making a context non-current implicitly forces a pipeline flush.
  On machines that support <tt>GL_KHR_context_flush_control</tt>, you can control
  whether a context performs this flush by setting the
  GLFW_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR window hint.

  The specified window must have an OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.  Specifying
  a window without a context will generate a GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT error.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose context to make current, or <tt>nil</tt> to
      detach the current context.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT and
  GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  This function may be called from any thread.

  This function returns the window whose OpenGL or OpenGL ES context is
  current on the calling thread.

  Returns: The window whose context is current, or <tt>nil</tt> if no window's
  context is current.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

{ Swaps the front and back buffers of the specified window.

  This function swaps the front and back buffers of the specified window when
  rendering with OpenGL or OpenGL ES.  If the swap interval is greater than
  zero, the GPU driver waits the specified number of screen updates before
  swapping the buffers.

  The specified window must have an OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.  Specifying
  a window without a context will generate a GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT error.

  This function does not apply to Vulkan.  If you are rendering with Vulkan,
  see <tt>vkQueuePresentKHR</tt> instead.

  Parameters:
    window: The window whose buffers to swap.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT and
  GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  This function may be called from any thread.

  SeeAlso:
    glfwSwapInterval

  Added in version 1.0. GLFW3 added window handle parameter. }
procedure glfwSwapBuffers(window: PGLFWwindow);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwSwapBuffers';

{ Sets the swap interval for the current context.

  This function sets the swap interval for the current OpenGL or OpenGL ES
  context, i.e. the number of screen updates to wait from the time
  glfwSwapBuffers was called before swapping the buffers and returning.  This
  is sometimes called <i>vertical synchronization</i>, <i>vertical retrace
  synchronization</i> or just <i>vsync</i>.

  Contexts that support either of the <tt>WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear</tt> and
  <tt>GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear</tt> extensions also accept negative swap intervals,
  which allow the driver to swap even if a frame arrives a little bit late.
  You can check for the presence of these extensions using
  glfwExtensionSupported.  For more information about swap tearing, see the
  extension specifications.

  A context must be current on the calling thread.  Calling this function
  without a current context will cause a GLFW_NO_CURRENT_CONTEXT error.

  This function does not apply to Vulkan.  If you are rendering with Vulkan,
  see the present mode of your swapchain instead.

  Parameters:
    interval: The minimum number of screen updates to wait for until the
      buffers are swapped by glfwSwapBuffers.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, GLFW_NO_CURRENT_CONTEXT and
  GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  This function is not called during context creation, leaving the
  swap interval set to whatever is the default on that platform.  This is done
  because some swap interval extensions used by GLFW do not allow the swap
  interval to be reset to zero once it has been set to a non-zero value.

  Some GPU drivers do not honor the requested swap interval, either
  because of a user setting that overrides the application's request or due to
  bugs in the driver.

  This function may be called from any thread.

    glfwSwapBuffers

  Added in version 1.0. }
procedure glfwSwapInterval(interval: Integer);
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwSwapInterval';

{ Returns whether the specified extension is available.

  This function returns whether the specified API extension is supported by
  the current OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.  It searches both for client API
  extension and context creation API extensions.

  A context must be current on the calling thread.  Calling this function
  without a current context will cause a GLFW_NO_CURRENT_CONTEXT error.

  As this functions retrieves and searches one or more extension strings each
  call, it is recommended that you cache its results if it is going to be used
  frequently.  The extension strings will not change during the lifetime of
  a context, so there is no danger in doing this.

  This function does not apply to Vulkan.  If you are using Vulkan, see
  glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions, <tt>vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties</tt>
  and <tt>vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties</tt> instead.

  Parameters:
    extension: The ASCII encoded name of the extension.

  Returns:
    <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> if the extension is available, or <tt>GLFW_FALSE</tt>
    otherwise.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, GLFW_NO_CURRENT_CONTEXT,
  GLFW_INVALID_VALUE and GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  This function may be called from any thread.

{ Returns the address of the specified function for the current context.

  This function returns the address of the specified OpenGL or OpenGL ES
  core or extension function, if it is supported by the current context.

  A context must be current on the calling thread.  Calling this function
  without a current context will cause a GLFW_NO_CURRENT_CONTEXT error.

  This function does not apply to Vulkan.  If you are rendering with Vulkan,
  see glfwGetInstanceProcAddress, <tt>vkGetInstanceProcAddr</tt> and
  <tt>vkGetDeviceProcAddr</tt> instead.

  Parameters:
    procname: The ASCII encoded name of the function.

  Returns:
    The address of the function, or <tt>nil</tt> if an error occurred.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, GLFW_NO_CURRENT_CONTEXT and
  GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

  The address of a given function is not guaranteed to be the same
  between contexts.

  This function may return a non-<tt>nil</tt> address despite the
  associated version or extension not being available.  Always check the
  context version or extension string first.

  The returned function pointer is valid until the context
  is destroyed or the library is terminated.

  This function may be called from any thread.

{ Returns whether the Vulkan loader has been found.

  This function returns whether the Vulkan loader has been found.  This check
  is performed by glfwInit.

  The availability of a Vulkan loader does not by itself guarantee that window
  surface creation or even device creation is possible.  Call
  glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions to check whether the extensions necessary
  for Vulkan surface creation are available and
  glfwGetPhysicalDevicePresentationSupport to check whether a queue family of
  a physical device supports image presentation.

  Returns:
    <tt>GLFW_TRUE</tt> if Vulkan is available, or <tt>GLFW_FALSE</tt> otherwise.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED.

  This function may be called from any thread.

  Added in version 3.2. }
function glfwVulkanSupported(): Integer;
  cdecl external GLFW3_LIB name _PU + 'glfwVulkanSupported';

{ Returns the Vulkan instance extensions required by GLFW.

  This function returns an array of names of Vulkan instance extensions required
  by GLFW for creating Vulkan surfaces for GLFW windows.  If successful, the
  list will always contains <tt>VK_KHR_surface</tt>, so if you don't require any
  additional extensions you can pass this list directly to the
  <tt>VkInstanceCreateInfo</tt> struct.

  If Vulkan is not available on the machine, this function returns <tt>nil</tt>
  and generates a GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE error.  Call glfwVulkanSupported
  to check whether Vulkan is available.

  If Vulkan is available but no set of extensions allowing window surface
  creation was found, this function returns <tt>nil</tt>.  You may still use Vulkan
  for off-screen rendering and compute work.

  Parameters:
    count: Where to store the number of extensions in the returned
      array.  This is set to zero if an error occurred.

  Returns:
    An array of ASCII encoded extension names, or <tt>nil</tt> if an
    error occurred.

  Possible errors include GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED and GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE.

  Additional extensions may be required by future versions of GLFW.
  You should check if any extensions you wish to enable are already in the
  returned array, as it is an error to specify an extension more than once in
  the <tt>VkInstanceCreateInfo</tt> struct.

  The returned array is allocated and freed by GLFW.  You should not free
  it yourself.  It is guaranteed to be valid only until the library is
  terminated.
